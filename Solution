Our Solution

TEAM SENTINEL is an automated AI-based early warning system that continuously monitors forest boundary areas using a camera and machine learning model.

When an elephant is detected:

>> SMS alert is sent to registered users through a GSM module

>> A buzzer activates as a local warning system

>> An IR sensor checks for nearby human presence to improve safety

The system operates in real time and does not require manual monitoring.
