Chhattisgarh Forest Area Planning

Chhattisgarh has very large forest coverage.

Total forest area ≈ 59,772 sq km

Around 44% of the state is forest land

Because the area is huge, you cannot place devices everywhere.

Realistic deployment strategy:

Suggested Monitoring Layout

Instead of full coverage:

Install nodes near:

Elephant corridors

Village borders

Forest entry paths

Crop edges

Example concept:

1 node covers ≈ 1–2 km radius

For pilot deployment:
20–30 nodes per forest division

This sounds professional to judges and GitHub readers.
