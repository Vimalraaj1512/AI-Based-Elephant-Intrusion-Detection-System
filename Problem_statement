Problem Statement

In many rural and forest-border regions, elephants enter farms and villages unexpectedly while searching for food or water. Farmers often receive no warning, which results in:

Crop destruction

Property damage

Economic loss

Human safety risks

Harm to elephants during conflicts

Traditional methods like barriers or harmful deterrents are not ethical or effective. This project proposes a smart technological solution that promotes coexistence instead of conflict.
