Project Overview

Human–Elephant conflict is a major issue in forest border areas, leading to crop damage, property loss, and danger to both humans and wildlife. TEAM SENTINEL is an AI-powered intelligent monitoring system designed to detect elephant movement in real time and provide early warning alerts.

This project combines Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and IoT communication to create a smart, automated safety solution that works without continuous human monitoring.

The goal of this system is simple:

Detect early
Alert immediately
Prevent damage
Protect both humans and elephants
