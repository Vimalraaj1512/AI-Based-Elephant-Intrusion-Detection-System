TEAM SENTINEL
AI‑Based Elephant Intrusion Detection & Prevention System
Project Overview
TEAM SENTINEL is an AI‑enabled wildlife monitoring system designed to reduce human–elephant conflict in forest border areas. The system uses computer vision, IoT communication, and non‑harmful deterrent mechanisms to detect elephant movement early, send real‑time alerts, and safely prevent intrusion.

Objectives
Detect elephant movement using AI vision

Send real‑time alerts to authorities and farmers

Activate safe sound & light deterrents

Reduce crop damage and improve safety

Support wildlife conservation

Technologies Used
AI / Computer Vision: OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite

Hardware: ESP32‑CAM, Sensors, Raspberry Pi

IoT & Cloud: Firebase / GSM Alerts
