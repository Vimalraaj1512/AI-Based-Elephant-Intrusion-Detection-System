WORKING OF FULL SYSTEM (Jetson + LoRaWAN + Sensors)
Step-by-Step Working
Monitoring

Each node includes:

Jetson Nano (AI processor)

Thermal camera

RGB camera

Acoustic sensor (sound detection)

PIR sensor (motion detection)

The system continuously monitors forest edges.

Smart Detection

Instead of running AI always:

PIR + Acoustic sensors wake up the system.

Then:

Thermal camera detects heat signature

AI model confirms elephant

This saves power — very important for solar systems.

Local Decision Making

Jetson Nano processes:

Image data

Thermal heat pattern

Sound frequency

If elephant confirmed:

Local buzzer / light deterrent activates.

Long-Range Communication (LoRaWAN)

Node sends alert using LoRaWAN.

Signal travels:

Node → LoRa Gateway → Forest Control Center

Advantages:

Works 5–15 km range

No mobile network required

Ultra-low power

Solar Power Working

Each unit uses:

100W Solar panel

LiFePO4 battery

Daytime → charging
Nighttime → battery supply

System runs fully autonomous.
